package Data::MuForm::Manual::FormHandlerDiff;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This documents the differences between FormHandler and MuForm, in order to
assist converting forms or deciding which package to use.

Note: the rendering is entirely different, so much that there's no point in
documenting the differences here. See the rendering documentation.

Localization now uses a gettext style .po file and a gettext type localizer.
Users can supply their own localizer as long as it can use the translation
files.

Added 'check' method for validation, which doesn't do 'update_model'.

Renamed 'field_name_space' to 'field_namespace'

Added 'data' alias for 'params', for better naming when doing simple validation

Standardized returns from attributes to arrayref, instead of array. If an array return
is available it will be in the 'all_' version. The important ones are 'options' and 'fields'.
A field 'options' returns an arrayref of options. 'all_options' returns an array. The 'fields'
attribute returns an arrayref of fields, 'all_fields' returns an array.

The names of the validation methods used in custom fields have changed. Use 'base_validate'
instead of _inner_validate.

The trim method is a separate coderef and is not added to the apply actions. Needs to
be defined as a simple coderef instead of an apply-style action.

The active => [] and inactive => [] no longer have a permanent build (on new) effect.
Do in your own form code if you want this. They still work the same on ->process.

The 'posted' flag has been renamed to 'submitted', because you also need on a 'get'. Also
a params hashref with no field named keys will not need the submitted flag.

The 'active' and 'inactive' flags are implemented slightly differently, but shouldn't affect
field definitions.

Removed 'use_fields_for_input_without_param'. Can be implemented in other ways.

Removed flag 'use_init_obj_when_no_accessor_in_item'. This should happen automatically now.

Removed flag 'use_init_obj_over_item'. Just use init_object in your process call instead.

Removed flag 'use_defaults_over_obj'. Use a transform instead.

Removed 'no_update' flag on form. Use 'check' method instead.

Removed 'update_field_list'. Can be implemented easily via user code if needed.

Removed 'defaults' on 'process'. Use init_object instead.

The inflate/deflate transforms have been renamed: 'inflate_method' = 'transform_input_to_value',
'deflate_method' = 'tranform_value_to_fif', 'inflate_default_method' = 'transform_default_to_value',
'deflate_value_method' = 'transform_value_after_validate'. Added new transform: 'transform_param_to_input'.

Removed 'deflation'.

Removed 'missing'.

Varous methods that could be set in a field definition have been moved into a 'methods' hashref:
'build_id', 'build_options', 'build_label', 'validate', 'default'.

TextArea field renamed to Textarea for consistency.

A number of trivial fields are no longer supplied by the distribution. If you need these fields
it should be pretty easy to create your own. Some fields not supplied: Hour, Minute, Month,
MonthDay, MonthName, Second, Weekday, Year, BoolSelect, DateMDY, PosInteger, Duration, DateTime,
Password, PasswordConf, IntRange.
